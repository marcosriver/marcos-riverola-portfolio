## Intro
Hi! My name is Marcos Riverola and I am a Full Stack Software Engineer. I have worked for 5+ years and this is my portfolio to showcase some of my work.
I am also a film photographer so I took the change to show some of my favourite pictures!

### Techonolgy
It is done with NextJS 14 and server components and deployed in cloudflare pages as it is a static site that does not change. 
All the assets are stored in Cloudflare R2 buckets, that live under a subdomain. They are integrated with the cloudflare CDN so their delivery is as fast as possible
to ensure a good user experience.
